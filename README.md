# MATres (Version 1.0)

Accurate targeting of brain areas for stimulation and/or electrophysiological recording is key in many therapeutic applications and in basic neuroscience research. Nevertheless, there are currently no end-to-end packages that accommodate all steps required for exact localization, visualization and targeting regions of interest (ROIs) using standard atlases and skull implants including various preprocessing, registration and warping procedures and 3D reconstructions. 


I have presented a noncommercial open source graphical software for its application (MATLAB based reconstruction for recording and stimulation or MATres).
